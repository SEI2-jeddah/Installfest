## Install GIT for windows
### Git for Windows stand-alone installer
1. Download the latest [Git for Windows installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

1. When you've successfully started the installer, you should see the Git Setup wizard screen. Follow the Next and Finish prompts to complete the installation. The default options are pretty sensible for most users.

1. Open a Command Prompt (or Git Bash if during installation you elected not to use Git from the Windows Command Prompt).

1. Run the following commands to configure your Git username and email using the following commands, replacing Emma's name with your own. These details will be associated with any commits that you create:
```bash
  $ git config --global user.name "Emma Paris"
  $ git config --global user.email "eparis@atlassian.com"
```

## GitBash for Windows
Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience. Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands. Bash is a popular default shell on Linux and macOS. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash, some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system.

### How to install Git Bash

Git Bash comes included as part of the [Git For Windows package](https://gitforwindows.org/). Download and install Git For Windows like other Windows applications. Once downloaded find the included .exe file and open to execute Git Bash.
